Javascript Homework

## Description 

This is currently a single web page with links to other pages. It generates a password that can be copied and used elsewhere based on input required from teh user when they click the Generate Password button. They must indicate whether to include upper case characters, lower case characters, numbers and or special characters. If they say no to include upper, lower and numbers then it just uses all special characters.
